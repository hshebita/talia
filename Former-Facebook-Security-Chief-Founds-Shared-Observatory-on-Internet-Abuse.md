Ex-Facebook Security Chief Alex Stamos is [supporting the development][link] of the Stanford Internet Observatory, a shared central outlet for tech firms to monitor internet abuse, including political disinformation, as part of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center. The Center would house the necessary machine learning tools, big data analysts, and access to user data, and is currently negotiating with major tech firms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube to access user data in real-time. They also plan to use data from sites with more extremist and abusive users such as 4chan, Voat, and Gab. Stamos believes that this centralized outlet could serve as a useful platform to monitor improper or abusive online activities.
