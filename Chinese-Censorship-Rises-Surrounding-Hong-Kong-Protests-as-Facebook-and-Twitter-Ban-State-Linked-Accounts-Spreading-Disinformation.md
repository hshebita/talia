Since protests began in Hong Kong this summer, China has used state media to manipulate [perceptions][link] of the situation domestically, in Hong Kong, and internationally. The countryâ€™s media and online censors have been manipulating the context of images and videos to undermine protesters, defend the Hong Kong police, and promote nationalism in a campaign which has included blatant disinformation as well as propaganda that often promotes anti-Western sentiments. Social media content that sympathized with the protesters or contextualized the protests was immediately taken down on domestic networks such as Weibo and WeChat. Both Twitter and Facebook [announced][link2] their discovery and removal of extensive networks of Chinese-based accounts spreading disinformation, and Twitter banned all state-sponsored media from advertising on its networks.
