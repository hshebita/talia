The German Marshall Fund released a [new report][link] that studies unilateral and multilateral efforts in Europe to counter Russian disinformation and hybrid threats. The paper uses six case studies to assess the extent to which new organizations are successful and avoid the “Band-Aid Effect.” Reliable funding is deemed essential, due to the disparity between spending levels of Russian interference operations and efforts to counter them. The report also highlights the importance of outreach to the press and public in order to raise awareness and increase resilience against the threat. Lastly, collaboration and the sharing of experiences between existing institutions is emphasized as a necessary aspect of creating long-term solutions.
