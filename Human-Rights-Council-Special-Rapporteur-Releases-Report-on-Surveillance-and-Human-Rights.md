A report released by the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur highlights [problems of targeted surveillance][link] used by governments to surveil individuals - often journalists, activists, opposition figures, and critics. It notes that such surveillance has grown amid weak regulatory controls, and has resulted in the arbitrary detention of individuals. Additionally, it proposes a legal and policy framework for regulation, accountability, and transparency within the private surveillance industry. It also calls for an immediate moratorium on the sale or transfer of tools used for private surveillance, tighter controls on surveillance exports, and restrictions on their use, in order to strengthen the protection of individuals' rights to freedom of opinion and expression.
