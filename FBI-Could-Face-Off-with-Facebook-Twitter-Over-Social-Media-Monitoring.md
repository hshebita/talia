The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) [requested][link] proposals for a tool to collect publicly available information from social media in order to identify and monitor online threats. The contracting solicitation asserts that it is possible to gather the data “while ensuring all privacy and civil liberties compliance requirements are met.” The social media monitoring service would likely violate the privacy policies of Facebook and Twitter, which explicitly ban the use of their data for surveillance purposes. The FBI and social media companies alike have been under increasing pressure to balance digital privacy with security in the face of mass violence and domestic terrorism.
