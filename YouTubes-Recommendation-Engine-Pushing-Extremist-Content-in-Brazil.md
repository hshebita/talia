YouTube generates video recommendations based on user history and behavior through an algorithmic system designed to maximize watchtime, and the system suggests more provocative videos to keep users entertained. An investigation by the New York Times, backed by studies by U.S. and Brazilian universities, [found][link] that the recommendation engine disproportionately diverts users to far-right and conspiracy channels. Members of Brazil’s supporters groups that back the current ultra-conservative administration credit the platform for their success and ability to reach a wider audience. The algorithm also has pushed users towards videos promoting conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination sites, among other politicized and often inflammatory content.
