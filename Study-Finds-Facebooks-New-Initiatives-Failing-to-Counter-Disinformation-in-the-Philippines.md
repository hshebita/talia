Facebook [invested][link] in third party fact-checkers and increased the removal of fake pages and accounts in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign in the Philippines. Philippine President Duterte’s 2016 victory was attributed largely to waves of false stories, trolling, and other forms of digital manipulation across social media platforms such as Facebook. However, [a new study][link2] by researchers from the U.S. and Australia indicates that Facebook’s improved policies have done little to counter disinformation tactics. In fact, such tactics became more widespread in the Philippines leading up to the 2019 midterm elections. Opposition candidates who once rejected these strategies seemingly embraced an increasing amount of “professional trolling” and information operations within political campaigns, findings which highlight the risks for upcoming elections in the U.S. and elsewhere in 2020.
