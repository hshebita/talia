D4D Coalition member the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has released a new report on [“Social Media, Disinformation and Electoral Integrity,”][link] which describes various aspects of disinformation in the online environment and their implications on elections worldwide. This follows IFES’ report from earlier in the year on [“Disinformation Campaigns and Hate Speech,”][link2] which explores the relationship between the two issues and implications for democracy and governance programming.
