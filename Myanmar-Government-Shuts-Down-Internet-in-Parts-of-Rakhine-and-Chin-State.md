On June 20, all telecom firms were [ordered][link] to temporarily stop mobile internet service in nine townships of Rakhine and Chin State. Security operations conducted by Myanmar’s military in Rakhine state have forced more than 720,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. While government officials assert that the shutdown is for security purposes, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar believes it could have the reverse effect since the blockage may result in a communication blackout that impedes journalists and citizens’ ability to share what is happening in the region.
