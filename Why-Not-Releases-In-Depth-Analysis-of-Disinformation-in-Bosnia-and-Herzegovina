Citizens’ Association “Why Not” utilized fact-checking platform [Raskrinkavanje.ba][link] to identify political disinformation targeting citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina between November 2017 and November 2018. Their in-depth [analysis][link2], which examines content published by over 450 digital media outlets, is the first of its kind to take place in the country. [The report][link3] analyzes the various types, sources, targets, beneficiaries, and redistributors of the disinformation. More than 60% of the articles containing information labeled as intentionally “false” or “misleading” dealt with political issues. The research found most sources of disinformation to be domestic, but identified a group of foreign outlets disproportionately using online tactics to push an agenda focused on undermining pro-democratic actors.
