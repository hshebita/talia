_The Intercept_ warns that [a collaboration][link] between U.S. chip manufacturer Xilinix, IBM, Chinese company Semptian, and the OpenPower Foundation, a non-profit led by Google and IBM executives, could be used to develop China’s surveillance state. While the collaboration itself is to develop microprocessors that enable computers to analyze vast amounts of data more efficiently, Semptian receives a large portion of its business through iNext, a front company that sells internet surveillance and censorship tools to the Chinese government. The company has developed a technology called Aegis which allows the government to see location information of everyone in the country by processing huge amounts of personal data.
